# Tykn's REST service

This is Tykn’s alternative to communicate with Hyperledger Indy nodes. With this service it’s
possible to send REST requests to the nodes without needing [ZeroMQ](https://zeromq.org/) a complex
messaging system.

Currently it is already hard to onboard new developers to
[Indy](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/hyperledger-indy) and
[Self-Sovereign Identity](https://sovrin.org/faq/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/) as both require a
lot of knowledge around [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain),
[asynchronous cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography),
[verifiable credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/),
[decentralised identifiers (DIDs)](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-primer/) and
[digital identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_identity). Putting another communication
paradigm in just makes it harder. So, we decided to build a tool that could facilitate
communication, creating this REST interface that any client can call to read and write to any
Hyperledger Indy node.

## How to deploy it

Pre-requirements:

1. A node-js 10+ environment
2. Internet access or
   [an Hyperledger Indy node running locally](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk#how-to-start-local-nodes-pool-with-docker)

First, clone this repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:tykntech/indy-rest-service.git
```

Then go into the cloned folder:

```
cd indy-rest-service
```

As it is a NodeJS service, you need to install the dependencies:

```
npm i
```

An then start the service:

```
npm start // npm mon for nodemon
```

## Open API Spec 3.0

Try our OpenAPI 3.0 spec at: http://rest-api.tykn.tech/doc

## How it works?

The API expects a transaction object built following the
[INDY specs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/indy-node/downloads/pdf/latest/). Usually, the
INDY-SDK builds those transactions.

A transaction-builder tool is being developed to help build transactions but, meanwhile, it needs to
be done manually.

1. Create a transaction (ATTRIB/NYM/SCHEMA/CRED_DEF/SCHEMA).

```JSON
// NYM transaction --- Signatures are just an example
{
  "operation": {
    "type": "1",
    "dest": "LnXR1rPnncTPZvRdmJKhJQ",
    "role": "0",
    // 000000000000000000000000Trustee2

```

  }
}
```

```JSON
// TAA transaction example
{
  "operation": {
    "type": "4",
    "version": "1.0",
    "text": "Here goes some acceptance text ..."
  },

  }
}
```

```JSON
// GET TAA data
{
  "operation": {
    "type": "6"
  },
  "identifier": "LibindyDid211111111111",
  "reqId": 1583864570,
  "protocolVersion": 2
}
```

2. Sign the transaction by the parties (you need to move the JSON around and sign it yourself)

```
Signing means hashing and adding a signature at the end of the JSON.
This can be achieved in many ways and we're also planning into providing a tool for that.
We can even use Hyperledger Aries to deal with this kind of communication.
```

3. Send the signed transaction to the POST endpoint

```
It's important to notice that the transaction must be signed by the target of
the transaction as the node will accept to deploy such transaction
```

We're still studying ways to improve this tool and we expect the community to help us with that.
